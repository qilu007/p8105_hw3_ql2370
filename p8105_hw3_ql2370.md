## Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

Instacart is an online grocery service that allows you to shop online
from local stores. In New York City, partner stores include Whole Foods,
Fairway, and The Food Emporium. Instacart offers same-day delivery, and
items that users purchase are delivered within 2 hours.

This dataset describes the order history of “The Instacart Online
Grocery Shopping 2017”, which has 1384617 objects and 15 variables
including order id, product id, user id, reordered, days since prior
order, department id, etc.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](p8105_hw3_ql2370_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
